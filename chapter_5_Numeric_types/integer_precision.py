#Python 2.X has a separate type for long integers , but it autometically converts any number to large to store in a normal integer to this type.
# Hence ,you don't need to code any special syntax to use longs ,and the only way you can tell that you are using 2.0X longs in that they print 
# with a trailing 'L'.Python 3.X supports unlimited size of integers.
